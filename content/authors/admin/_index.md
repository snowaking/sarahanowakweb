Sarah Nowak is an Assistant Professor in the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont. She is a core faculty member in the Center for Health Services Research and a member of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Sarahâ€™s research broadly focuses on understanding how social influences and past personal experiences impact patient and provider decision making, particularly around cancer screening and vaccination. Sarah was previously a senior information scientist at the RAND Corporation, where she spent a decade applying mathematical simulation approaches to policy research questions. In particular, she was a lead modeler developing and using the RAND COMPARE microsimulation model to analyze a wide range of different health insurance reform proposals.
